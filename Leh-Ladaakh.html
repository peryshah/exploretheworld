                <h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>

                <p>The holiday in Leh-Ladakh is on top of the priority list of most adventure enthusiasts. Known as
                    the “Land of High Passes”, Ladakh is a dream for many mostly because it provides a wide range of
                    opportunities for thrill seekers. The town of Leh, which is the capital of the region is popularized
                    by many travelers because it encompasses a significant part of Ladakh's history and adds to its rich
                    culture. </p>
                <p>In this road trip to Ladakh, we explore many destinations that are not only major attractions but
                    carry the essence of Ladakh in their very walls. From Buddhist monasteries preserving ancient relics
                    and thangka paintings in their abode to the iconic motorable high passes that attract bike riders
                    from all over the country, this Leh-Ladakh tour is specially curated to provide you the thrill you
                    seek as well as give you a glimpse at the serenity that the beautiful valleys of Ladakh have to
                    offer. </p>
                <p>This trip starts from our arrival at Leh. Since the altitude is high and weather conditions are
                    harsher compared to plain regions, it's necessary to allow your body to get acclimatized properly.
                    Spending a day in Leh is a crucial part of this Ladakh road trip. Since the ascend isn't gradual,
                    many travelers face certain health-related issues when they embark on this journey but you won't
                    have to worry if you let your body adapt to the conditions. </p>
                <p>After spending a night under the starry skies, you will perhaps realize what you were missing out on
                    while stuck in the daily hustle and bustle of your life in the metropolitan cities where the air
                    isn't quite as fresh as the one that billows in the heart of Ladakh.</p>
                <p>Our first stop for the Leh sightseeing in this Ladakh road trip would be none other than the
                    confluence of Zanskar and Indus rivers, locally known as Sangam, located at Nimmu on the
                    Leh-Srinagar highway. Indus, also known as the Sindhu river, is the main source of water for the
                    entire valley when it comes to irrigation practices. The blue waters surrounded by the earthly brown
                    hues of the mountain blend together to offer a view that is not only pleasing to the eyes but fill
                    your heart with awe as you witness nature work its magic.</p>
                <p>Other tourist attractions in Ladakh that we make sure you must visit include the Gurudwara Pathar
                    Sahib, a beautiful Gurudwara built in memory of Guru Nanak Sahib in 1517. It is a sacred belief in
                    Sikhism that Guru Nanak Dev traveled to many places during his lifetime and one of those places was
                    Tibet. Even the Buddhists of this region consider him to be a Saint and call him by the name of Guru
                    Gompka Maharaj.</p>
                <p>The next stop during the local sightseeing tour in this Ladakh road trip is the Magnetic Hill. It has
                    gained popularity for its gravity-defying phenomena. At a staggering height of 14,000ft, the uphill
                    slopes seem to pull the vehicles upwards even if you wish to drive in the opposite direction. A
                    board marks the location of the hill so you can't miss it when driving on the roads of Leh. What
                    makes these cyclops hills even more interesting is that the locals believe that the road is a
                    gateway to heaven. </p>
                <p>One of the major attractions in Ladakh is perhaps the most symbolic embodiment of courage and valor.
                    The Hall of Fame, a memorial constructed by the Indian Army to honor the legacy of the Indian
                    soldiers who lost their lives during the many wars that occurred post-partition. The museum has a
                    wall named “The last post” where the last letter written by Captain Vijayant Thapar before his
                    martyrdom is preserved in the frame. Simply being here, surrounded by the history of our soldiers
                    and how they lived their lives, how they sacrificed it will surely leave you feeling overwhelmed and
                    teary-eyed. </p>
                <p>The next stop in our Ladakh road trip will provide you with some much-needed peace of mind. The
                    Shanti Stupa is a beautiful white-domed structure that holds ancient relics of Buddha in its
                    embrace. Apart from being the abode to such notable emblems of Buddhist culture, it is also
                    enshrined by the 14th Dalai Lama himself. It has gained popularity not just because of its spiritual
                    significance but the scenic view that is in the backdrop of the Stupa. </p>
                <p>We won't confine ourselves to Leh in this Leh-Ladakh road trip but explore the many valleys and
                    villages the travelers paradise has to offer. We will make a small trip to Nubra valley from Leh
                    first. In Tibetan, Nubra is called Dumra which means valley of flowers and the name perfectly suits
                    the vast expanse of land that stretches like a blooming spring field. The best part about this mini
                    road trip from Leh to Nubra is that you'll be traversing through Khardung La pass which is one of
                    the highest motorable passes in the world, with a staggering height of 18,379 ft. The pass is a
                    gateway to the Shyok and Nubra valleys. Adventure enthusiasts from across the world come on this
                    pass to experience the thrill of riding their bikes at high altitudes. You can also indulge in
                    exciting activities like Double Hump Bactrian Camel safari, ATV rides, and more. </p>
                <p>One of the coolest things about this 7-day road trip is that this Ladakh tour comes with an
                    expedition to Turtuk. Turtuk is India's last outpost and was once a part of Pakistan before the
                    Indian Army captured it during the war of 1971. This road trip to Ladakh becomes perfect when you
                    spend some time in Turtuk which is known for its variety of fruits, especially apricots. </p>
                <p>The next destination would be Pangong Lake, a name you might be familiar with if you are into pop
                    culture specifically Bollywood. The lake was featured in the iconic scene in the blockbuster
                    Bollywood movie 3 Idiots. It has also been featured in some popular Shah Rukh Khan flicks like Jab
                    tak hai Jaan and Dil se. Apart from being a treat to the eyes with its pristine blue waters, what
                    makes the lake interesting is that it doesn't allow outflow to any other water bodies. </p>
                <p>En route to Pangong while on this Ladakh road trip, we will make a stop to pay our respects at the
                    Diskit Monastery which is the oldest and the largest monastery in Leh. It is known for the 106 ft
                    tall statue of Buddha that is perched on top of the hill. The Monastery has its roots dating back to
                    the 14th century with frescos and paintings depicting ancient tales of Buddhist culture. </p>
                <p>After our day's excursion, we will set up camp with the Pangong Lake in the backdrop. A night with
                    starry skies and a soothing breeze would give you the peace of mind that metropolitan cities have
                    deprived us of. In a nutshell, this Leh road trip with Turtuk s one of a kind that covers the
                    majority of attractions in Ladakh and makes the experience the perfect blend of thrill and peace.
